# mnistvisualizer
Interactive visualization of a neural network along with a simple nn library made from scratch

I created my own simple neural network library using numpy that supports fully connected, relu, and softmax layers with cross entropy loss, and used it to train a simple nn on the mnist dataset. 
Then, I created a visualizer that allows you to draw your own numbers, and it will show the probabilities for each digit.

You can train your own network in model.py, or use the one that I provided, and test the visualizer in main.py.
Press c to clear your drawn digit.
